# TJPCov

TJPCov is a general covariance calculator interface to be used within LSST DESC.

This is currently a placeholder with a handful of functions that may be useful.
See the notebooks in the examples directory.

## Installation

The placeholder TJPCov is now pip installable for convenience, but for development
clone the git repository.
